# To Do List
here you can see an example of Tedjs.
opposite of aml when you create an element , you can use it in multiple position and you can set rols for it easly.

in this case you can `append` a `list` element to the `todo` element and it will parse it to the right form.
```
tedApi.append("#todo","<list>test</list>")
```
